Three pots of various heights are placed on the right side of the table; from front to back, these are: a small green pitcher with a round handle and a spout on either end, a large light-blue pot or jug with two round handles, an ornate lid, and a spout at its base, and, lastly, a short, green pot from which emerge the red and white tendrils of a plant. Behind the table, taking up most of the background space on the left, are two panels of a decorated folding-screen; the panel on the left has a floral motif of entwined pink, yellow, blue, and lavender flowers with green leaves on a whitish-pink ground, and the panel on the right is light blue. Each panel is bordered on the right by a vertical strip of brown wood. In the right corner, a green curtain has been pushed to the far right to reveal a thin, vertical strip of green, pink, blue and lavender that might be depicting foliage and flowers, visible in the garden beyond what is assumedly an open door.
