Three pots of various heights are placed on the right side of the table; from front to back, these are: a small green pitcher with a round handle and a spout on either end, a large light-blue pot or jug with two round handles, an ornate lid, and a spout at its base, and, lastly, a short, green pot from which emerge the red and white tendrils of a plant. Behind the table, taking up most of the background space on the left, are two panels of a decorated folding-screen; the panel on the left has a floral motif of entwined pink, yellow, blue, and lavender flowers with green leaves on a whitish-pink ground, and the panel on the right is light blue. Each panel is bordered on the right by a vertical strip of brown wood. In the right corner, a green curtain has been pushed to the far right to reveal a thin, vertical strip of green, pink, blue and lavender that might be depicting foliage and flowers, visible in the garden beyond what is assumedly an open door.

The sea takes up two-thirds of the lower, left side of the canvas. A series of dark, medium and light blue and green strokes, mixed with a bit of black in some areas, evoke the swells of the sea, and an application of white impasto at the edge of the sea suggests the frothy edge of the ocean as it tumbles onto the shore. The pink toned edges of the waves pick up the light of the setting (or rising sun) visible on the horizon in the upper left. In the right foreground, three figures, one bending down to pick up something, stand at the shoreline. Behind them on the shore is a dark smudge that could be a small boat or caloge. In the background small quick, red and green strokes suggest figures on the shore, while larger black and red strokes cursorily depict the dark and red roofs of buildings in the town. Sandstone cliffs with grassy, green tops rise in the distance along the shore and end in a curved arch out in the sea; on top of them in the distance is a church with a steeple.",,Paintings,"Barnes, Albert C. and Violette de Mazia.

In the left foreground, a man with dark hair and a moustache, dressed in a grey suit, and wearing a striped tie, sits in a chair reading a book and smoking a cigarette. On the right a young woman with light brown hair, wearing an elegant white blouse and a black neckband, helps a young boy at a piano; both are absorbed in their task. Only the head and shoulders of the woman and the head of the boy are visible behind the sheet music and the stand of the Pleyel piano which is before them in the foreground. A green publication (a music score) with the name of the composer Haydn on the front and a violin and bow in an open violin case rest on top of the bright pink lid of the piano in the foreground.  Both the right arm and legs of the man in the chair and the end of the piano are cropped by the bottom edges of the canvas. On the wall behind the two figures at the piano is the corner of a picture with a yellow frame on which is depicted a woman with a blue skirt and black top sitting on a tall stool; her head and part of the canvas are cut off by the right edge and top of the canvas. A French window with a light blue frame is open to reveal the garden outside. Just below the window along the wall inside the room is a white radiator. Beyond the ornamental grill of the window in the garden, a woman, in profile, sits in a rocking chair, bent over her sewing. Behind her, in the following order, is a grey path, a small pool, a statue of a nude woman with water cascading into the pool, and a zone of lush green foliage.",,Paintings,"Aragon.
